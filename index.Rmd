Hello. I am Aditya Dahiya, an Indian Administrative Service Officer working in Chandigarh. I enjoy data visualization and health data-science as an avocation. Here are some of my works:

1.  [Solutions](https://aditya-dahiya.github.io/RfDS2solutions/) to R for Data Science (2nd Edition) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, Garrett Grolemund.

2.  [Solutions](https://github.com/Aditya-Dahiya/ISLR-Solutions-Aditya-Dahiya "GitHub Repo for Solutions") to the Book *An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R* by Daniela Witten, Gareth M. James, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani.

3.  An ArcGIS [story](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/d38a1bd805204c17b1b9a26a632889b0) I did as a project at Harvard Kennedy School.
